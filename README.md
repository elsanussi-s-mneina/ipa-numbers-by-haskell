# IPA character encoded in Unicode, and as IPA Numbers conversion

This project converts IPA numbers (such as 123) to IPA characters (such as Ê€, which is the symbol for the voiced uvular trill, encoded in unicode at U+0280).

This is a compiled, command line program.

It was originally part of the https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/phonetics-modeling project.

## Important References:
These are the data that this program is trying to implement:

# Project status
- This part is incomplete, come back in a week it will probably be complete by then.
- currently conversion is both ways, which direction can be specified using command line flags.
- unit tests have been migrated over from the parent project.

## Tasks left to do:
- go over unit tests and ensure all cases are covered.


## Developer software requirements
- Glasgow Haskell Compiler

## Developer knowledge requirements
- how to type standard input onto console, (hint use ctrl-D on a blank line to end the file) or how to redirect input from a file to a program.


## Basics of how to use:
### How to compile
Either run the file titled `compile.sh` or run the commands within it.

`./compile.sh`

If it does not work, run clean.sh first.

### How to run
`/.run.sh`

Then you have to provide input, something like "123" without the quotes.
Then enter a new line, and then hold the ctrl key and press the D key.

### How to run unit tests
`test.sh`
